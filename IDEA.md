# Project Idea – Phishing Email Detection & Trend Analysis

## 💡 Idea Overview
Phishing emails are one of the most common and dangerous cyber threats faced by organizations.  
The idea of this project is to use **data analytics and visualization** to analyze phishing email behavior and identify patterns that can help improve cybersecurity awareness.

Instead of using complex machine learning models, the project focuses on **simple, clear, and effective analysis using Power BI (Free Version)**.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Organizations receive thousands of emails daily, making it difficult to manually identify phishing attempts.  
Phishing emails often appear legitimate but aim to steal credentials, spread malware, or trick users into making payments.

Without proper analysis:
- Phishing trends go unnoticed  
- High-risk domains are not identified  
- Security awareness remains reactive  

---

## 🎯 Proposed Solution
This project proposes a **Power BI–based analytical dashboard** that:
- Analyzes historical phishing email data  
- Identifies phishing trends over time  
- Highlights high-risk sender domains and regions  
- Shows common phishing attack types  

The solution helps security teams **understand phishing behavior** and take preventive actions.

## 🛠 Approach
1. Collect phishing email data (simulated dataset)  
2. Clean and transform data using Power Query  
3. Perform descriptive and trend analysis  
4. Build interactive Power BI dashboards  
5. Generate insights for cybersecurity awareness

## 👥 Target Users
- Cyber Security Analysts  
- SOC (Security Operations Center) Teams  
- IT Security Teams  
- Data Analysts working in cybersecurity  

---

## ✅ Expected Outcome
- Clear visualization of phishing email trends  
- Identification of high-risk domains and periods  
- Better understanding of phishing attack patterns  
- Improved security awareness through data insights
